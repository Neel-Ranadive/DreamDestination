    <h1>My Dream Destination is Japan!</h1>
    <h2>There are so many amazing things you can see and do in Japan including:</h2>
    <h3>Eating sushi and ramen, go-kart racing in the middle of the street, ride amazing rides in large amusement parks, taking samurai lessons, eating sushi on a boat, go to large seafood markets, getting served food by robots in a robot-run restauraunt, and eat noodles that come down a large bamboo shoot.</h3>
    <p>Sushi and ramen are my favorite foods and I enjoy eating different types including california and crab sushi rolls, smoked salmon nigiri rolls, and ramen  with chicken or shrimp.</p>
    <p>I went go-kart racing once in Atlantic City on thhe boardwalk and I found it fun so I would enjoy doing it again but on the streets of Japan as it would be an interesting and fun method of transport.</p>
    <p>I have seen videos of the amusement parks in Japan after watching videos from large influencers so I would like to try the rides and see if I will have as much fun, if not more.</p>
    <p>I have seen samurai lessons taken by travelers that post videos on the internet and I found it interesting and entertaining because it would be fun to see if I would pass as a sword user.</p>
    <p>I enjoy eating sushi and it would be even more fun if it was when I am traveling on a boat because of the experience.</p>
    <p>I want to see the large seafood markets in which so many fish enter and leave everyday as it is one of the largest in Japan and has a large variety of fish in stock.</p>
    <p>I would find it fun to get food served by robots because I would find it interesting.</p>
    <p>I would also like to go to a restauraunt which has noodles that come down a bamboo shoot which you can grab with chopsticks and place in your bowl.</p>
